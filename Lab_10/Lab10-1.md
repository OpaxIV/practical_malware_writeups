# Lab 10.1

This lab includes both a driver and an executable. You can run the execut-
able from anywhere, but in order for the program to work properly, the
driver must be placed in the C:\Windows\System32 directory where it was origi-
nally found on the victim computer. The executable is Lab10-01.exe, and the
driver is Lab10-01.sys.


1. Does this program make any direct changes to the registry? (Use procmon
to check.)
2. The user-space program calls the ControlService function. Can you set a
breakpoint with WinDbg to see what is executed in the kernel as a result
of the call to ControlService?
3. What does this program do?
