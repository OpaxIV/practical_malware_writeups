# Lab 10.3

This lab includes a driver and an executable. You can run the executable
from anywhere, but in order for the program to work properly, the driver
must be placed in the C:\Windows\System32 directory where it was originally
found on the victim computer. The executable is Lab10-03.exe, and the driver
is Lab10-03.sys.

1. What does this program do?
2. Once this program is running, how do you stop it?
3. What does the kernel component do?
