# WinDBG Setup Instructions


1. 


2. Setting the Environment Variable
    - Got to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-symbols
    - Under "Debugger Reference --> Environment Variables --> General Environment Variables" you will find the name of the variable.
    - Under the same link go to "Symbols for Windows Debugging --> Symbol path for Windows debuggers" to find the needed path.
    - Using the command line input the following commands:
        - Create a new folder for the symbols to be installed (mine is "C:\symbols")
            `md c:\symbols`
        - Input the command to create a new environmenal variables:
            `setx _NT_SYMBOL_PATH "cache*c:\symbols;srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"`



    On computer B from an administrator terminal:

    Enable kernel debugging bcdedit /debug on
    Setup the connection to Computer A for debug bcdedit /dbgsettings hostip:1.2.3.4 port:50005
    Enable test signing bcdedit /set testsigning on

For the command bcdedit /dbgsettings, for hostip set the IP of your Computer A, for port choose the one you want between 50000 and 50039.


The bcdedit /dbgsettings will output a Key, KEEP IT it will be used on the windbg configuration on Computer A to establish the connection !
