# Lab 9

## Lab 9.3
Analyze the malware found in the file Lab09-03.exe using OllyDbg and IDA Pro. This malware loads three included DLLs (DLL1.dll, DLL2.dll, and DLL3.dll) that are built to request the same memory load location. Therefore, when viewing these DLLs in OllyDbg versus IDA Pro, code may appear at different memory locations. The purpose of this lab is to make you comfortable with finding correct location of code within IDA Pro when you are looking at code in OllyDbg.

1. What DLLs are imported by Lab09-03.exe?
2. What is the base address requested by DLL1.dll, DLL2.dll, and DLL3.dll?
3. When you use OlldyDbg to debug Lab09-03.exe, what is the assigned based address for: Dll1.dll, DLL2.dll, and DLL3.dll?
4. When Lab09-03.exe call an import function from DLL1.dll, what does this import function do?
5. When Lab09-03.exe call `WriteFile`, what is the filename it writes to?
6. When Lab09-03.exe creates a job using `NetScheduleJobAdd`, where does it get the data for the second parameter?
7. While running or debugging the program, you will see that it prints out three pieces of mystery data. What are the following: DLL1 mystery data 1, DLL 2 mystery data 2, and DLL 3 mystery data 3?
8. How can you load DLL2.dll into IDA Pro so that it matches the load address used in OllyDbg?
