# Lab 11.3
**Disclaimer:**
This analysis might be incomplete. I did my own analysis of the malware without consulting the book (or at least as little as possible). After having finished writing down my thoughts, I read the full analysis found in the book, to compare my results with theirs.



Analyze the malware found in Lab11-03.exe and Lab11-03.dll. Make sure that
both files are in the same directory during analysis.
