# Lab 11.2
**Disclaimer:**
This analysis might be incomplete. I did my own analysis of the malware without consulting the book (or at least as little as possible). After having finished writing down my thoughts, I read the full analysis found in the book, to compare my results with theirs.



Analyze the malware found in Lab11-02.dll. Assume that a suspicious file
named Lab11-02.ini was also found with this malware.

1. What are the exports for this DLL malware?
2. What happens after you attempt to install this malware using
rundll32.exe?
3. Where must Lab11-02.ini reside in order for the malware to install
properly?
4. How is this malware installed for persistence?
5. What user-space rootkit technique does this malware employ?
6. What does the hooking code do?
7. Which process(es) does this malware attack and why?
8. What is the significance of the .ini file?
9. How can you dynamically capture this malwareâ€™s activity with Wireshark?
