## Practical Malware Analysis Labs

This repository contains my writeups to the malware labs of the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig.
Any used references from the book or external sites have been added to the bottom of each lab. It is to be stated, that some parts were copied 1:1 from the original sources, if I found them to be easy and clear enough to understand.
Be aware that these writeups may contain errors, since they represent my interpretations of the malware samples.
